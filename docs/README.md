# Introduction

Hi! I'm Tung Dang, a software engineer @ Business Intelligence department of [otto.de](https://www.otto.de) in Hamburg. Currently, I'm working in a team that builds tools and infrastructure for machine learning systems. Prior to that, I co-founded [idatase](https://idatase.de), a start-up offers data analytics services for Internet of Things. 

I'm an opensource contributor and developer and have general interests in efficient data processing, machine learning & distributed computing. 

In [my blog](/blog/) I'll share my thought about different topics.

I love the convenience of Markdown, this site content is written completely in markdown with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org).
